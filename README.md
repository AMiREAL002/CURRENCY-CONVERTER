# Currency-Converter-using-Java
This a basic Currency Converter application created by using Java 8. For further details read below.

# Design
- We have the GUI as output with 2 labels, 2 text-fields, and 11 buttons
- Initially, the text-fields have values of 0.0.
- The user can then enter a numerical value to be converted from Indian Rupee to a particular foreign currency mentioned on the buttons on the left panel.
- Similarly, the user can convert the value entered in the right text-field from a particular foreign currency to its equivalent Indian rupee value.
- Respective conversions are displayed in the corresponding text-fields.
- The Close button then can be used to close the application.
